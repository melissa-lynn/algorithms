  <title>Properties</title>

  <p>In this section, we'll introduce and prove some general properties about <q>big O</q>. These properties are useful to determine the asymptotic behavior of functions, without needing to resort to a proof from the definition.</p>

  <p>If you've been thinking about asymptotics and practicing your proofs, you've probably already made the following observation: the asymptotic behavior of a polynomial function is determined by the degree of its highest degree term. This is restated in the claim below.</p>
  
  <claim xml:id="claim-polydeg">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>f(n)=a_dn^d+a_{d-1}n^{d-1}+\cdots +a_2n^2+a_1n+a_0</m> is a polynomial of degree <m>d</m>, then <m>f(n) = O(n^d)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </claim>

  <proof>
