  <title>Selection Sort</title>

  <p>Selection sort works by repeatedly finding the next smallest item in the array, and moving it into the correct position. Here is pseudocode for selection sort.</p>

  <program>
    selection_sort

    input: array of integers of length n
    state change: array of integers sorted into ascending order

    for each position in the array:
      find the smallest item in the array, at or after the current position
      swap the item at the current position with the item just found

    return
  </program>

  <p>Here is more detailed pseudocode, that we will use for our runtime analysis. This pseudocode also makes it straightforward to implement the algorithm in many programming languages.</p>

  <program>
    selection_sort

    input: array of integers of length n
    state change: array of integers sorted into ascending order

    for i from 0 to n:
      min_index gets 0
      for j from i to n:
        if array[j] \lt array[min_index]:
          min_index gets j
      swap array[i] and array[min_index]

    return
  </program>
