  <title>Merge Sort</title>

  <p>Merge sort works by dividing the array into its first half and second half, sorting each half, then merging the two halves resulting in a sorted array.</p>


  <program>
    merge_sort

    input: array of integers of length n
    state change: array of integers sorted into ascending order

    if the length of the array is 0 or 1:
      return

    call merge_sort to sort the first half of array
    call merge_sort to sort the second half of the array

    new_array is initialized as an empty array

    iterate through the first half and second half of the array simultaneously
      if the current item in the first half is less than the current item in the second half:
        append the current item from the first half to new_array
        go to the next item in the first half
      else:
        append the current item from the second half to new_array
        go to the next item in the second half

    if there are remaining items in the first half of the array:
      append them to new_array

    if there are remaining items in the second half of the array:
      append them to new_array
    
    copy new_array into the original array

    return
  </program>
