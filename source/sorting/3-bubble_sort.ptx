  <title>Bubble Sort</title>

  <p>Bubble sort works by iterating through the array, swapping pairs of items that are out of order. It repeats this iteration until the entire array is in order.</p>

  <program>
    bubble_sort

    input: array of integers of length n
    state change: array of integers sorted into ascending order

    while there was a swap in the previous iteration:
      for each position in the array:
        if the next item is less than the current item:
          swap the current item with the next item

    return
  </program>
