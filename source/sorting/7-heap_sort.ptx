  <title>Heap Sort</title>

  <p>Heap sort works by inserting all items in a min-heap, then repeatedly removing the minimum value from the heap to produce the items in increasing order.</p>

    <program>
    heap_sort

    input: array of integers of length n
    state change: array of integers sorted into ascending order

    heap is an min-heap

    for each item in the array:
      insert the item in the heap

    for each position in the array:
      extract the minimum value from the heap and assign it to the current position in the array

    return
  </program>
