  <title>Tree Sort</title>

  <p>Tree sort works by inserting all items in a binary search tree, then performing an in-order traversal of the tree to extract the items in increasing order.</p>

    <program>
    tree_sort

    input: array of integers of length n
    state change: array of integers sorted into ascending order

    tree is an empty binary search tree

    for each item in the array:
      insert the item in the tree

    traversing the tree in order, copy the items back into the array

    return
  </program>
