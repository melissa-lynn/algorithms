  <title>Proving <m>T(n)=O(f(n))</m></title>

  <claim>
    <p>
      <m>n=O(n^2)</m>
    </p>
  </claim>

  <p>
    Translating this statement into the formal definition, we need to prove that for functions <m>T(n)=n</m> and <m>f(n)=n^2</m>, there exist <m>c\gt 0</m> and <m>n_0\geq 0</m> such that if <m>n\geq n_0</m>, then <m>T(n) \leq c\cdot f(n)</m>. In other words, if <m>n\geq n_0</m>, then <m>n \leq c n^2</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Based on our previous investigation, there are various choices for <m>c</m> and <m>n_0</m> that could work here. One such choice is <m>c=1</m> and <m>n_0=1</m>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, let's write our formal proof.
  </p>

  <proof>
    <p>We will show that there exist integers <m>c\gt 0</m> and <m>n_0\geq 0</m> such that if <m>n\geq n_0</m>, then <m>n \leq cn^2</m>.</p>
    <p>Let <m>c=1</m> and <m>n_0=1</m>. Then, if <m>n\geq n_0</m>, we have:
      <md>
        <mrow>n \amp = 1\cdot n, \amp\amp</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp \leq n\cdot n, \amp\amp \text{ because }n\geq n_0=1,</mrow> 
        <mrow> \amp \leq n^2, \amp\amp</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = 1\cdot n^2, \amp\amp</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = c\cdot n^2, \amp\amp \text{ because }c=1.</mrow>
      </md>
    Thus, we have <m>n\leq cn^2</m>, proving that <m>n=O(n^2).</m>
    </p>
  </proof>
