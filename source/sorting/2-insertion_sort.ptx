  <title>Insertion Sort</title>

  <p>Insertion sort works by sorting the array from the beginning, adding one item at a time by finding its correct position in the sorted portion of the array.</p>

  <program>
    insertion_sort

    input: array of integers of length n
    state change: array of integers sorted into ascending order

    for each position in the array:
      current is the item at the current position
      while current is less than the item in the previous position:
        swap current with that item

    return
  </program>
