  <title>Selection Sort</title>

  <p>Selection sort works by repeatedly finding the next smallest item in the array, and moving it into the correct position. Here is pseudocode for selection sort.</p>

  <program>
    selection_sort

    input: array of integers of length n
    state change: array of integers sorted into ascending order

    for each position in the array:
      find the smallest item in the array, at or after the current position
      swap the item at the current position with the item just found

    return
  </program>
